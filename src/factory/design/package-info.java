/**
 * This package supports designing Joomla! Extensions in a graphical way. It
 * supports dragging and dropping elements of a Joomla! extension onto a graph
 * that displays the entire application under development. It also supports
 * simulation, that is, dry running the application that is being developed and
 * getting a glimpse of the flow of control.
 * <p/>
 * A Joomla extension consists of forms, fields, database tables, MVC classes,
 * to name but a few and the relationships thereof. The purpose of this package
 * is to model the distinct parts of a Joomla! extension and the messages that
 * are passed between these parts. It will allow the designer to look at a
 * wholesome picture of the application in question and edit the structure of
 * the application from the view point of an end user.
